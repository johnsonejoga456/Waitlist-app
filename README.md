## 📡 API Endpoints  

### `POST /api/waitlist` - Register a user to the waitlist  
#### Request Body

2. Connect the repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).  
3. Add the environment variables in Vercel settings.  
4. Deploy!

### **Backend (Firebase Functions Deployment)**
1. Install Firebase CLI:  
   ```sh
   npm install -g firebase-tools

## ❓ Troubleshooting  

❌ *Next.js not found?*  
   - Run `npm install next react react-dom`  

❌ *Deployment taking too long?*  
   - Ensure dependencies are installed correctly.  
   - Restart Vercel build.  

❌ *Emails not being sent?*  
   - Check SendGrid API key.  
   - Verify Firebase Function logs.
